Goal: To loop through each {tr} and get From{td} then each W = 20%
      then apply algorithm to calc Win% given Form and Overall W%

WDDWW = 60/100


Possible Events
* W and D and L

Win Rate = 13/20 = 0.65
Win Form = 60/5  = 0.6
WR + WF /2 * 100 = 62.5%

LDLWL = 1/5
Win Rate = 9/20 = 0.45
Win Form = 0.2
32.5

WR 4/19 = 0.21
WF 2/5 = 0.4

0.4 + 0.21 = 0.61/2 = 0.31 x 100 = 31%
